With Delphi exposed, it didn't take long for
sleeper cells to be found and eliminated.
The end of medical terrorism seemed to
be within reach.

Professor Blackwell pledged his full
cooperation with Caduceus in the ongoing
investigation.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT600A_003
<telop 0>
Although it was his daughter's kidnapping
that forced Blackwell to cooperate, he
maintained that Delphi's actions would have
been impossible without his research.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT600A_004

When offered a formal pardon, Blackwell
insisted that he serve out his term in prison.
He thanked Derek and Angie for giving him
a second  chance to atone for his mistakes.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT600A_005
<telop 1>
The professor's testimony provided a clearer
picture of the international terrorist
organization known as Delphi, and shed light
on their intentions.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT600A_006
<telop 1>
Delphi held to a dangerous ideology
preached by their leader, a mysterious man
who called himself Adam.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT600A_007
<telop 1>
Their financial backing came primarily from
holdings they absorbed from a number of
international pharmeceutical conglomerates
such as the Eidoth Corporation.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT600A_008
<telop 2>
The major world powers combined resources
in a massive search for Delphi's headquarters.
It wasn't long before they located it:
a fortified vessel in the Atlantic Ocean.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT600A_009
<telop 2>
Dr. Stiles and Nurse Angie were asked to
accompany the British Navy in a raid on
Delphi's aquatic facility.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT600A_010
<telop 2>
A horrifying discovery awaited them inside
the vessel; one which demonstrated the cruel
lengths to which Delphi had gone to develop
their GUILT...
<wait>

@MSG_EVT600A_011
<telop 3>
They had kidnapped children from all over
the world to serve as hosts for the original
subspecies of GUILT.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT600A_012
<telop 3>
Dr. Stiles and Angie operated on these victims,
who were taken into protective custody once
they were free of the virus.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT600A_013
<telop 4>
And, in the hidden depths of the vessel, Derek
came face to face with Adam--the
mastermind behind medical terrorism, and the
main objective of the raid.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT600A_014
<telop 4>
...Although, having absorbed GUILT into his own
body, Adam had become scarcely more than
a corpse.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT600A_015
<telop 4>
The vapors present in Adam's chamber were
enough to momentarily incapacitate Derek,
though British forces soon located and
revived him. At last, the mission was complete.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT600A_016
<telop 4>
Adam's GUILT-infested remains were
confiscated by the British Navy, and their
current whereabouts are unknown.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT600A_017
<telop 4>
For all intents and purposes, Delphi has
been destroyed.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT600A_018

Several months have passed since that time.

Caduceus USA has continued its ongoing
battle against intractable diseases.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT600A_020
<telop 0>
They have seen many members come and go,
but their mission to research new treatments
has continued, with Dr. Derek Stiles at the
forefront.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT600A_021
<telop 0>
Thanks to the vigilant efforts of Caduceus
USA, memories of the plague known as
GUILT have finally started to vanish.
<wait>

However...
<wait>
<telop_cls>

@MSG_EVT601A_001
<bup 0 17 1>
...This new medication is sweet. The patients
have been responding really well.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_002
<bup 0 16 1>
Well, I'm not usually one to brag...
<wait>
Let's just say I expected nothing less
than perfection.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_003
<bup 0 17 1>
Shouldn't you give some credit to Blackwell
since he, you know, thought of it?
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_004
<bup 0 16 1>
There is a fine line between theory and
creation.
<wait>
I question your abilities as a doctor if you
don't appreciate that difference.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_005
<bup 0 14 1>
All right, Victor... Blackwell thought up a
method of treatment, and you made it work.
<wait>
Can we drop it now?
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_006
<bup 0 16 1>
Whatever...
I still made it work.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_007
<bup 0 17 5>
It kinda sucks we're the only ones who will
ever know Blackwell had anything to do with it.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_008
<bup 0 14 1>
We're fortunate he agreed to help us while
paying his debt to society.
<wait>
The world needs Professor Blackwell's
research more than anyone will ever know.
<wait>
<bup_cls>

@MSG_EVT601A_009
<bup 0 18 2>
...Welcome back, Dr. Stiles! You too, Angie!
Thanks for the souvenirs.
<wait>
That Pochy was deliciousâ€¦
I'm such a slave to Japanese treats.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_010
<bup 0 8 2>
Glad you liked it.
<wait>
We didn't have much time to appreciate Tokyo,
though, since most of our time was spent on
<wait>
conferences and hospital visitations.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_011
<bup 0 2 4>
I think I'm still a little jet-lagged...
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_012
<bup 0 18 2>
*sigh* Can't you at least try to act like you're
a world-renowned super doctor?
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_013
<bup 0 8 1>
Have you heard back from Dr. Myers? I'd like
to know how she's adjusting to Hope Hospital.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_014
<bup 0 18 2>
...Oh, I forgot! The Director wanted to see
you two as soon as you got back.
<wait>
It must be tough being so popular, huh?
You'd better head up to his office.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_015
<bup 0 8 1>
Well, thanks for letting us know.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_016
<bup 0 2 1>
Think there's any chance he's going to give
us a vacation?
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_017
<bup 0 18 2>
Hmm...?
I seriously doubt it.
<wait>
<bup_cls>

@MSG_EVT601A_018
<bup 0 2 1>
...A long-term assignment in Great Britain?
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_019
<bup 0 8 1>
Will I be going as well?
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_020
<bup 0 13 1>
Yes. They asked for both of you specifically.
<wait>
They're in the final stages of some project and
asked that our most skilled doctors participate.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_021
<bup 0 9 5>
We were hesitant about their proposition...
<wait>
But, considering they finally decided to ask for
our help after months of silence, we agreed.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_022
<bup 0 13 1>
Caduceus Europe will also be holding a
conference there, in about a month.
<wait>
We'd like you to attend that as well, and
Director Hoffman will be joining you.
<wait>
Like he said, the British have been quiet
about their research since the raid.
<wait>
...Now, all of a sudden, they're asking outside
organizations for help with some project.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_023
<bup 0 9 5>
They must be extremely confident if they're
willing to break their silence on the issue...
<wait>
...considering they were unwilling to share any
information on Delphi only months ago.
<wait>
We would like you to keep us posted on
their activities while you're there.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_024
<bup 0 2 1>
So, they're sharing their data? I thought you
said they just wanted skilled surgeons.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_025
<bup 0 13 1>
They made sure we understood none of their
research was to be made public...
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_026
<bup 0 9 5>
Director Miller is a good man, but I worry
about all this secrecy...
<wait>
I can only assume the government wanted to
have others involved as a safety measure.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_027
<bup 0 13 1>
Are you willing to accept, knowing that there's
more to this than meets the eye?
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_028
<bup 0 2 1>
...I understand the situation. But, if they need
our help, I'm willing to go.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_029
<bup 0 8 1>
We accept.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_030
<bup 0 13 1>
We've made preparations for you to leave in
five days. You'll be on duty as usual until then.
<wait>

@MSG_EVT601A_031
<bup 0 9 5>
I'll see you both in a month.
<wait>
<bup_cls>
