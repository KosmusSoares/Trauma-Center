Mankind strives toward death...
Only a fool could deny that.

No matter how hard you try, you cannot
overcome the power of death!

Your skills have given birth to many lives
which never should have been.

As it is written in Revelation 9:6,
"During those days men will seek death, but
<wait>
will not find it--they will long to die, but
death will elude them."
<wait>
Just as the prophecy states, I have set a
plague upon mankind to torment those
<wait>
who have betrayed natural law. ...At the end
of all life, I alone will stand as an angel
<wait>
before the gaping abyss... I, who have
become the great destroyer Apollyon!
<wait>
...Your medicine is deceit, and you are
nothing but a false prophet...
